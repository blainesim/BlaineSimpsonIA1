	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>My Thoughts on the Results:</b></font></br></br>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">I think that personality tests such as the one above have some extent of validity. If the test designers have some form of 
	professional expertise in the personality field, then they may be able to give a general analysis of someone's personality with a few questions. However,
	I oppose to them being able to give an accurate breakdown of one's personality by simply asking a few questions online.</br></br>I wouldn't say that my results
	are completely accurate. I definitely don't think that I am more materialistic than the average person; in fact I would say I am more satisfied and humble
	than the average person. I also don't think that I am more easygoing than the average person as I tend to stress on things day to day. Some of the careers
	listed for me are some that I would never see myself doing. Therefore this test is not completely accurate but I wouldn't say that it is inaccurate as some
	parts are true.</font>
