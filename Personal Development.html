	<font face="Georgia" size="10"><b><center>My Strengths</center></b></font>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>I would believe that I have a number of strengths; however, my main ones are:</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5"><ul><li>Leadership</li><li>Teamwork</li><li>Discipline</li><li>Responsibility</li></ul></font></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>• Leadership -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">I think leadership is a valuable trait which everyone should aim to aquire. I have been working on my
	leadership abilities since high school. In grade 7 I was given the form captain role and was assigned various duties. In grade 9 I was
	the captain of the basketball team, I had to lead the team during training and matches. In grade 10 and 11 I was a sub-prefect and a 
	peer counsellor, I was given higher roles to help maintain order within the school and be someone younger students could look up to and ask
	questions they would like to. I continued my leadership in university by taking leadership positions in group assignments so the work could
	be done on time and of great quality.</font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>• Teamwork -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Having great teamwork abilities is something everyone should aim for. I truly understood how valuable 
	teamwork is when I joined the basketball team in grade 8. While playing a team sport, if everyone isn't working together and sharing the
	same goal, the team will not be successful. We had to work together throughout every game to win the games. In grade 10 and 11 when I was a
	part of the prefect body, we had to work together to ensure order is maintained within the school. Some prefects would do their part,
	others wouldn't and it would be noticed when some weren't doing their part as there wouldn't be order. In university, I had to develop my
	teamwork abilities even more to complete group assignments. All group members shared the common goal as to pass the module, therefore we
	had to work together to ensure the assigments were done properly and submitted on time.</font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>• Discipline -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Discipline is one of the most important traits in life. One can never advance to another area in their life
	without discipline. I learnt that discipline is important in my first year of high school. Before high school, school was relatively easy,
	I thought that it would be the same in high school. I continued my old habits such as playing games after school instead of studying, and 
	procrastinating on assignments. I failed a number of classes because of this; that's when I realized that I had to display discipline and
	limit myself to fun and focus on school. By doing this my grades went from horrible to great. In university I had to reach a new
	level of discipline, I had to limit myself even more and focus more on school work, by doing this I've only failed one module and gotten
	A's and B's in all others.</font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>• Responsibility -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Responsibility is as important if not more than discipline. A part of maturity is responsibility so one is
	not mature if they are irresponsible. My parents always ensured that I learnt to be responsible, when they bought me gadgets, if I didn't
	take care of them, I would be punished and wouldn't be given another one anytime soon. In grade 10 when my father bought me a laptop, I
	brought it to school and had it in my backpack. I was playing with another student, and I fell on my back. I got home and the screen of
	the laptop was broken. I had to save my lunch money to buy a replacement screen and after, I could only use it for school assignments.
	That was my major lesson of responsibility. When I got my driver's license this year, I was trusted by my mother to drive her car
	to get to where I needed to. I knew that I couldn't let anything happen to the car, so I ensured that I drove safely and just got to my
	destination and back home. I showed responsibility here as I ensured that I limited any oppurtunity for something to go wrong.</font>

	<font face="Georgia" size="10"><b><center>Summary of "Twelve Pillars"</center></b></font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>★ Goal Setting -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there. 
	Setting goals that will take you out of your comfort zone, and expose you to new things is 
	what will lead you to the future you want. Don’t let others set goals for you, set goals for yourself.</font></br><br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>★ Opportunities -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The 
	impact of regret has a greater effect than the impact of discipline. Your best opportunities 
	each day are those which match with your overall goal, and that’s what you should focus on.</font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>★ Your Associates -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Some important questions to ask yourself:  Who am I around?  What effect are they having 
	on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they
	have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Finally, ask yourself: is that okay?
	</br>Successful people try to establish relationships with other successful people who will push, 
	challenge, and encourage them to become better. To attract mentally attractive people, you 
	must be mentally attractive. Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you associate with.</font></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b>★ Self Education -</b></font>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Self-education is what you teach yourself.  It is what you learn along the way so that you are 
	constantly improving and growing. You must be focused and continue to learn to separate yourself from everyone else.
	Learning is the beginning of wealth, health and spirituality. You must search and learn to 
	advance yourself. Most of life is lived after formal education; that means the rest of it is up to you.</font></br></br></br>
	<font face="Georgia" size="5"><b><center>How I can apply the lessons from "Twelve Pillars" to my life</center></b></font></br>
	<font face="calibri" size="5">Firstly, to start improving in life, I need to set goals for myself. Everyday I will aim to get a step
	further in achieving my goal until I finally achieve it. I will look out for every opportunity that presents itself and make use of it.
	It is better for me to test out each opportunity than to regret not doing so later. I will associate myself with people who share similar
	goals as mine and ensure they are helping me to elevate instead of negatively influencing me. I will also try to build relationships with
	successful people so they can challenge and encourage me to achieve my goals. Finally, I will continue educating myself. Researching and
	reading constantly will help me to constantly improve and grow mentally. I will stay focused and continue to learn to begin a life of
	wealth, health and spirituality.</font>
